# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-in-python.
This project demonstrates the application of EDA techniques to understand, clean, and prepare a dataset for further modeling. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the notebook explores data distributions, identifies missing values, detects outliers, and uncovers relationships between variables.
Key highlights:
Data cleaning and preprocessing for analysis.
Visualization of trends, correlations, and patterns.
Hypothesis testing to validate assumptions.
Preparation of insights that can guide predictive modeling and decision-making.

This project showcases practical EDA skills essential for data analytics and machine learning workflows
