# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-in-python.
This project demonstrates the application of EDA techniques to understand, clean, and prepare a dataset for further modeling. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the notebook explores data distributions, identifies missing values, detects outliers, and uncovers relationships between variables.
